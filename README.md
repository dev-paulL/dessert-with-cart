## My process

I wanted to learn how to build a shopping page with a cart, so I chose this challenge as my second React project.

- 📸 Analyzed screenshots to organize the page and its components.
- 📱 Focused on the simpler mobile design first 
- 🛒 Implemented cart functionality (adding, removing, changing item quantities) step by step to ensure thorough understanding.
- 🎨 Imported font and colors, then designed the components
- 🖥️ Adapted the layout for tablet and desktop :
  - Mobile: One dessert per row, cart at the end of the page.
  - Tablet: Two desserts per row, cart on the right.
  - Desktop: Three desserts per row, cart on the right.
- ✅ Added the confirmation modal and styled it for all device sizes.
- 🌀 Implemented animations for link and button hovers, adding items to the cart, and modal.
- 🌐 Started adding ARIA rules. I am currently learning about screen readers and how to ensure a good experience for all users.

### Built with

- **React**
- Vite
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox & Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
